**Setting Up Live Sass Compiler in Visual Studio Code**
To make working with SCSS a breeze, you can use the Live Sass Compiler extension in Visual Studio Code. Here’s a quick guide on how to get it up and running:

1. Install the Extension

Open Visual Studio Code.
Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac).
Search for “Live Sass Compiler”.
You can find the extension by Ritwick Dey by hitting Install.

2. Compile SCSS to CSS
You can just open your SCSS file (e.g., styles.scss).
You’ll see a “Watch Sass” button in the bottom-right corner of VS Code. Click it, and the extension will start watching your SCSS file.
As you make changes and save your SCSS file, it will automatically compile to CSS.

3. Link the Compiled CSS in Your HTML
